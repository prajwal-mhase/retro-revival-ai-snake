# AI Design – Retro Revival Snake

This project uses an agent-based adaptive AI system.

## AI Inputs
- Player score
- Snake position
- Food position
- Distance from walls
- Near-miss frequency

## AI Decisions
- Increase speed for skilled players
- Reduce speed when player struggles
- Warn player visually when collision risk is high

## AI Outputs
- Dynamic speed adjustment
- On-screen AI hints
- Visual head color change

This approach demonstrates real-time decision-making and adaptive intelligence without heavy ML models.
